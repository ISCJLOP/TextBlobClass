Invocation
May that apparent calm called scepticism
never riddle my heart.
Let me escape
from the numbness of cynicism
from the impartiality of shrugged shoulders.
Let me believe always in life
let me believe alwaysin infinite possibilities.
Deceive me, song of the sirens
confer a gleam of naivety!
Epidermis, never resemble
a frozen implacable hide.
Let me always cry
for impossible dreams
for forbidden loves
for girlish fantasies torn into pieces.
Let me escape from straight-jacketed realism.
Safeguard these songs on my lips,
may they be numerous, noisy and replete with chords.
To sing away the threat of silent times.
